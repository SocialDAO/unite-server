# unite-server

Content publication endpoint for Unite.cash

## Requirements

You will need node and npm.

You will need to have IPFS installed on your system and have the location of the
binary added to your PATH environment variable.

If you are running a public gateway, you will need to expose your endpoint
somehow. You may use Tor or open a port on your firewall. The more ways clients
can connect with you the better.

## Installation

Clone this repo, change to its root directory on your system and run npm install

## Usage

To run the server: npm run start.
